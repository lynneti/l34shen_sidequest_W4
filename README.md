## Description

This sketch demonstrates how a 2D array represents a maze/game level.

---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Nested loops to iterate through grid rows/columns
- Converting grid coordinates (r,c) → screen coordinates (x,y)
- Tile-based rendering (every cell = one rectangle)

---

## Assets

N/A

---

## GenAI

I was trying to turn the Week 4 grid sketch into a simple data-driven level system by storing levels in JSON/arrays and using nested loops to render tiles, then adding a player character, collectible “word” items, and an automatic switch to Level 2 after finishing Level 1
